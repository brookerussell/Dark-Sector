This is a short note to explain the files that I'm uploading to the git repository. I denote a file included with *** so that they can be seen easily.

I am including four types of files (grouped into folders of the same name):

====================================================================

1. LArSoft files that are used for reading MC files. ("EWH_LArSoft")

   These are on the uboonegpvm and involve the direct use of MC. 

   For the 2015 APS I was using LArSoft v03_04_00_e6_prof

   The full address of everything used for the 2015 APS is of the form
   /uboone/app/users/ehimwich/v03_04_00/srcs/larexamples/DarkPhotonAna/*

   The necessary classes in LArLight are in /LArLight/UserDev/MinaTest
   
   For only the LArSoft step of the analysis, the following classes are necessary:
   *** MinaTestEvent.c[h]c[h]
   *** MinaTestParticle.c[h]c[h]
   *** MinaTestPhoton.c[h]c[h]
   
   And the following LArSoft files are necessary:

   *** DarkPhotonAna_module.cc
   *** darkphoton.fcl

   The MCC5 files are looped over using the wrapper:

   *** AnaScript.sh

   The above shell script is in principle the only file that needs to be run.

   Only geometry cuts are made in this preliminary file reading; all the analysis is performed externally using LArLight. 

   _____________________________________________________________

   The filenames of imported MC are of the form:

   prodgenie_bnb_nu_uboone_53047_${i}_gen_53053_${i}_g4.root

   The TTrees exported are of the form:

   MCC5_v03_BNB_Cosmics_Hist__*

   Each are included in folder 4 ("Datafiles").

=====================================================================

2. Files to perform analysis externally in LArLight. ("EWH_LArLight")

   The classes used from LArLight (/UserDev/MinaTest/*) are:

   *** MinaTestEvent.c[h]c[h]
   *** MinaTestParticle.c[h]c[h]
   *** MinaTestPhoton.c[h]c[h]
   *** LineDist.c[h]c[h]

   In order to copy files from uboonegpvm to an external computer, I used:

   *** CopyScript.sh

   The analysis was performed in C++ using a module in LArLight/UserDev/MinaTest/*

   *** DarkPhotonAnaC.c[h]c[h]

   Which was wrapped in a python script that looped over LArSoft output:

   *** dark_photon_ana.py

   This was in the UserDev/MinaTest/mac/ directory. To run:

   > python dark_photon_ana.py

======================================================================


3. Plotting files for histograms and energy cut plots. ("EWH_Plotting")

   These routines in python extract the correct histogram and format the plot.

   Some changes need to be done by hand to the canvas when it pops up.

   One file created Energy histograms:

   *** Dark_Sector_Plots.py

   One file created Distance histograms:

   *** Dark_Sector_Plots_Distance.py

   A separate module was used to plot the results of energy and distance cuts:

   *** CutPlots.py

   To use this file, you must open the python interpreter and call functions:

   > python
   > import CutPlots
   > CutPlots.EnergyCuts()
   > CutPlots.DistanceCuts()

======================================================================


4. Files with all the information that was used. ("Datafiles")

   4a. MCC5 Data with bnb and cosmics ("MCC5_Raw")

       These are of the form:

       *** prodgenie_bnb_nu_uboone_53047_${i}_gen_53053_${i}_g4.root

   4b. Histograms generated by LArSoft module ("MCC5_Hist")

       These are of the form:

       *** MCC5_v03_BNB_Cosmics_Hist__*

   4c. Final plots and APS presentation ("APS15")

       *** APS_Pi0Distance_Area4.gif
       *** APS_Pi0Energy_Scaled.gif
       *** EnergyCutsMCC5_Final.jpg
       *** DistanceCutsMCC5_Final.jpg
       *** APS_Presentation_Himwich.pdf
       *** APS_Presentation.pptx
       *** APR15_PROOF.jpg
